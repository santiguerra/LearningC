# LearningC
I am learning C and want to show you my progress. In this repository, you can see 8 projects that reflect my journey.

## Projects Overview
These are the projects I've completed throughout my apprenticeship, from 1 (the first) to 8 (the latest).

1. **InteractingWithUser**  
   In this project, I learned how to interact with the user in the console. So, I asked the user how many shells they wanted.

2. **Learning**  
   Here, I explored data types (e.j., `char`, `int`, `float`, `double`) and how to display variables storing these types in the console.

3. **Strings**  
   I learned how to store strings in variables, which are mostly user responses. This taught me how to request and store them effectively.

4. **ComprobantePago**  
   This project (in Spanish) was inspired by a church's request for personal information (name, surname, ID) to process donations and provide payment proof.

5. **Switch**  
   After learning about the `switch` statement, I created a program where the user enters the time, and the program suggests an activity based on it.

6. **While**  
   I mastered the `while` loop by building a budget manager. You set a budget, enter your spends, and the program tracks what’s left, even showing a graph with asterisks.

7. **StepsCount**  
   Continuing with loops, I used `for` to create a weekly step counter. You set a weekly goal, log daily steps, and it tells you if you’ve met it or how much you need to walk.

8. **FindANumber**  
   To conclude, I developed a mini-game where you guess a randomly chosen number in 7 attempts, with clues to guide you (up, down, close, or far).

## Requirements
- A C compiler (gcc).
- A terminal to run the programs.

## How to execute
1. Compile each file with `gcc nombre_del_archivo.c -o nombre_ejecutable`.
2. Run with `./nombre_ejecutable` (Linux/macOS) or `nombre_ejecutable.exe` (Windows).
